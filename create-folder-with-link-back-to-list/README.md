# Create folder with link back to list

## Summary

This sample creates a folder in a *SharePoint* document library and then stores the link to the newly created folder inside of *Microsoft Lists* using *Power Automate*. The folder name is based on a combination of list columns and provides a better link experience compared to the default URL.

## Features

This sample illustrates the following concepts:

* Expressions
* SharePoint REST API
* Variables


## Prerequisites

This Flow requires the following list columns and settings:
* **Title**
	* Settings: "Require that this column contains information" set to **Yes**
* **FolderLocation**
	* Type: *Hyperlink* 


## Minimal Path to Awesome

1. Download the solution file [CreateFolderWithLinkBackToList.zip](/create-folder-with-link-back-to-list/solution/CreateFolderWithLinkBackToList.zip)

2. Import the solution using *Power Automate*. Click **My flows**, click **Import** and then click **Import Package (Legacy)**

 	![Flow import](/create-folder-with-link-back-to-list/assets/flow-import.png "Flow import")

3. Upload the solution by clicking **Upload** and select the downloaded file from Step 1

	![Upload package](/create-folder-with-link-back-to-list/assets/upload-package.png "Upload package")

4. Configure the *Flow* connections by clicking on **Configuration** for the *SharePoint Connection*

 	![Import configuration before image](/create-folder-with-link-back-to-list/assets/import-configuration-before.png "Import configuration before image")

5. Select an existing connection and click **Save** or add a new *SharePoint Connection* by clicking **Create new** (see Steps 5a, 5b)

	![Existing or new connection](/create-folder-with-link-back-to-list/assets/existing-new-connection.png "Existing or new connection")

	5a. Click **Create a connection**, click **SharePoint** and then click **Create**

	![New SharePoint connection](/create-folder-with-link-back-to-list/assets/sharepoint-connection.png "New SharePoint connection")

	5b. Select your account in the *Pick your account screen*

	5c. Return to the *Import setup* screen, select your newly created *SharePoint Connection* and click **Save**

	![New SharePoint connection](/create-folder-with-link-back-to-list/assets/save-sharepoint-connection.png "New SharePoint connection")

6. After our Flow connections have been created click **Import** to import the solution file.

	![Import configuration after](/create-folder-with-link-back-to-list/assets/import-configuration-after.png "Import configuration after")

	**Note:** If you receive a "GetTable" error during the import, click the **Save as a new flow** option and manually update the connections references. This error is caused by importing and exporting *Flows* between tenants.

	![Flow import error](/create-folder-with-link-back-to-list/assets/flow-import-error.png "Flow import error")
	
	Select your target connection to fix the "Invalid connection" error. Repeat for all SharePoint actions.
	![Fix connections](/create-folder-with-link-back-to-list/assets/flow-fix-connections.png "Fix connections")

7. Click **Open flow** to further configure the flow

	![Open flow](/create-folder-with-link-back-to-list/assets/open-flow.png "Open flow")
	
8. Expand the *When an item is created*, change the *Site address* and *List name* to your desired site and list 

	![Configure When an item is created](/create-folder-with-link-back-to-list/assets/when-an-item-is-created.png "Configure When an item is created")

9.  Expand *Initialize variable - varParameters*, change the *Site address* and *List name* to your desired site and list

	![Configure Initialize variable](/create-folder-with-link-back-to-list/assets/initialize-variable.png "Configure Initialize variable")

	Name | Value
	---- | ------
	*varSiteURL* | Replace with your site URL
	*varListInternalName* | Replace with your internal list name; **Tip:** Use this API call in your browser to obtain the internal list name: *https://<YourTenantName>.sharepoint.com/sites/<YourSiteName>/_api/Web/Lists/GetByTitle('<YourListNameWithSpaces')?$select=ListItemEntityTypeFullName*
	*varListDisplayName* | Replace with your list display name
	*varColumnInternalName* | Replace with the internal column name; **Tip:** Use the list column settings to see the internal name at the end of the URL string
	*varDocumentDisplayLibraryName* | Replace with the Document Library display name.
	*varFolderName* | Update the expression as required; by default the expression concatenates the list ID column with the Title column values: *concat(triggerOutputs()?['body/ID'], '-', triggerOutputs()?['body/Title'])*

	![Turn on Flow](/create-folder-with-link-back-to-list/assets/turn-on.png "Turn on Flow")

13. Test your *Flow* by adding a new item to your list. If successful the Flow will:
    1.  Create a folder in our target *SharePoint* Document Library with a name that concatenates the *ID* and *Title* columns
    2.  Update list item *FolderLocation* column to match the folder name
![Your flow ran successfully](/create-folder-with-link-back-to-list/assets/flow-run.png "Your flow ran successfully")

Our list item looks like the image below. Clicking on the *FolderLocation* link will take you to the folder location.
